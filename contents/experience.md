### **Engineer Experience**  
**2022.09 – 2023.03 | The 8th Hebei Provincial College Students' Engineering Practice and Innovation Ability Competition - Intelligent Logistics Handling (First Prize of Hebei Province)**  

Intelligent logistics handling is an integrated engineering project, mainly divided into mechanical design, circuit design, material selection, assembly, and programming processes. It achieves functions such as color and QR code recognition, automatic line patrol, and robotic arm grabbing.

#### Key Contributions:  
- Took primary responsibility for mechanical design, circuit design, assembly, and site construction. Seized this opportunity to learn PCB design and recognition-related content, while accumulating substantial programming skills.
- The MCU selected for this competition was Arduino Mega 2560, which offers notable advantages: sufficient pins (54 digital input/output pins, including 15 analog input pins), 4 UART interfaces (for communication with the robotic arm, OpenMV, serial screen, and gyroscope), and a 16MHz crystal oscillator. These features make it highly suitable for beginners.
